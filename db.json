Tourism is an important industry in the country and makes up more than 10% of Egypt’s economy."

      "Despite the attempts at improving security, Egypt’s hot air balloons have a minor reputation for unsafety. This is due to the death of a South African tourist in January 2018 when a hot air balloon crashed; the incident also left many tourists injured and was attributed to poor weather conditions.Moreover, Egypt holds the record for the deadliest balloon accident in history. In 2013, a hot air balloon crash incident ensued when a balloon caught fire in mid-air.",

      "In Egypt, they are also popular among archaeologists and Egyptologists who seek to capture an ‘overview’ angle of various archaeological sites. This is due to the fact that the use of drones—commonly used in the field of archaeology—by non-military personnel is illegal in Egypt."

      "Served with croutons (or any other type of crunchy bread) and with lemon on the side, Egyptian lentil soup is a staple on most menus year-round, but winter is when we really learn to appreciate this hearty and filling soup.

Walk the streets of any city in Egypt and sooner or later you’ll smell something distinctly sweet and smoky at the same time -- it’s the siren call of the resident batata (sweet potato) street cart.

Add some sugar, vanilla, shredded coconut and a sprinkle of cinnamon and nuts and voila; the winter drink of our childhood. ",
      "Best place for sahlab: while sahlab can be found in every cafe and ahwa in the city, they sometimes use the instant sachets of sahlab which are just… no. If you want the real deal, you can buy the orchid roots at an attar (a common Egyptian shop that sells all kinds of herbs and spices) and make it at home. ",

      "description": "With around 200 nationalities represented in Egypt, how people dress is incredibly varied – yet the traditional attire of Egypt is bold and distinctive. You can see it all across the city. \n\n Egyptian national dress is a symbol of pride and identity that has been designed with the dual intent of providing comfort and adhering to religious beliefs. In Egypt, men wear an ankle-length, loose-fitting garment made of white cotton, known as a kandora or dishdasha. A ghutrah covers the head and is held in place by the agal, a type of black cord. This garment was originally used to protect the face from the harsh desert environment, \n\n Traditionally, women in Egypt wear an abaya – a long, flowing light coat over their clothing. This is worn over their Western clothes or a traditional long-sleeved full-length dress known as a jalabeya. A black scarf is often draped over the head. ",
